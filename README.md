# Installation And Setup Anular

Angular is a popular open-source JavaScript framework developed by Google for building dynamic web applications. To get started with Angular, you need to install and set it up on your system.

Here are the steps to install and set up Angular:

1. Node.js Installation: Angular requires Node.js, so the first step is to install Node.js. Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

2. Angular CLI Installation: Angular provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool that makes it easy to create and manage Angular projects. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally on your system:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

3. Verify Installation: Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by running the following command:

```
ng version
```

This command will display the installed version of Angular CLI and other related dependencies.

4. Create a New Angular Project: With the Angular CLI installed, you can now create a new Angular project. Navigate to the desired directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
ng new my-angular-app
```

Replace "my-angular-app" with the name you want to give to your project. The Angular CLI will create a new directory with all the necessary files and dependencies for your project.

5. Run the Angular Application: Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory by running:

```
cd my-angular-app
```

Then, start the development server by running the following command:

```
ng serve
```

This command will compile the Angular application and start a local development server. You can access your application by opening a web browser and visiting `http://localhost:4200`.

That's it! You have successfully installed and set up Angular on your system and created a new Angular project. You can now start building your Angular application by modifying the project files in the created directory.

Note: It's important to keep your Angular CLI and project dependencies up to date by regularly checking for updates and running the necessary commands to update them.

Remember to refer to the official Angular documentation (https://angular.io) for more detailed information and guidance on Angular development.
